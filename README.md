# M2 Log Analyzer AI

Lightweight AI-powered log ingestion and anomaly detection system written in Go.  
A modern, minimal alternative to ELK, focusing on concurrency, stream processing, and embedded ML.

## ðŸš€ Features (planned)
- Real-time log ingestion (HTTP, syslog, file, Kafka/NATS)
- Concurrency-first design (worker pools, Go channels)
- Stream parsing & enrichment
- Anomaly detection (rolling stats, Isolation Forest, Autoencoder)
- Alerts (Slack, webhook, email, Prometheus)
- Optional storage (SQLite, ClickHouse, in-memory)
- Lightweight deployment (Docker + Kubernetes)
